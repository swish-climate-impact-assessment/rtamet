TAMET

The aim of this package is to make the TAMET tools for checking Meteorological data available to R users.

The TAMET program [http://www.apsim.info/Portals/0/OtherProducts/Using%20TAMET2.htm] was originally developed by APSIM, especially  P deVoil and  J Hargreaves based on the work of B. H. Wall of the CSIRO Div. of Tropical Crops and Pastures in 1977. It performs a range of checks on weather files for consistency.
